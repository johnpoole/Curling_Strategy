# Curling Strategy

# 1. First Ends (Ice Discovery)

- Learn draw weight on both sides.  
- Learn curl on both turns.  
- Test board/hack weight when needed.  
- Prefer draws. Aim for top 4 or top 8.

---

# 2. Middle Ends – With Hammer

## Lead
- Draw to the side 8-foot on the preferred side.  
- Target depth: top 8.

### Follow-up (“The Box”)
- If the first draw is short → draw around it.  
- If the first draw is good → guard it.  
- Avoid starting in the centre.

### Exception
- If the opponent’s lead cannot draw → draw top 4.

## Second
- If opponent has a centre guard with a stone behind it → peel the guard.  
- If they leave an open stone → board-weight hit, hope for a roll.  
- If there is a guard and we already have a side stone → draw around the guard (with or without backing).  
- If the corner setup is lost and they control the centre → switch to clearing and blanking.

---

## Third
- Remove guards that help them.  
- Remove stones that help them.  
- Guard stones that help us.  
- Draw to backing when available.  
- If they have two buried and we have no angles → switch to damage control.

---

## Skip
- First stone sets up the last shot: guard a good stone, draw behind cover, or clear trouble.  
- Last stone: take the simplest available scoring option (open draw, open hit, or blank).

# 3. Middle Ends – Without Hammer

## Lead
- Centre guard or draw top 4.  
- If they draw deep → freeze.  
- If they play to the wings → centre guard.

## Second
- Remove their corner guards.  
- If they come around a corner and we cannot remove → freeze or tap.  
- Add a centre guard if the centre is developing in our favour.

## Third
- Keep the centre contested.  
- Remove any stone that gives them an easy score of two.  
- If they bail, remove guards and keep the 4-foot clear.

## Skip
- Guard to maintain a force.  
- Freeze if they have shot and we need to take it away.  
- Hit anything that gives them an angle for two.

# 4. General Principles

- Top is good; deep is bad.  
- Use backing when available; avoid giving backing.  
- Remove guards instead of attempting thin or perfect shots.  
- Guard height: tight for protection, mid for setup, high for control.  
- Adjust after misses (long → shorter next shot; short → longer next shot).  
- Everyone thinks one shot ahead; question unexpected calls.  
- Time the ice.  
- Follow the opponent’s lines.  
- Leave opponent stones that help us; remove ones that hurt us and are fully visible.

# 5. Scoreboard Guidelines

- Up after 3 → no guards.  
- Down → throw guards.  
- Up after 5 → draw top of the house and remove their stones.  
- Focus on preventing the score they need, not increasing ours.

---

# 6. Bailout Conditions

Switch to clearing/blanking when:  
- They are buried twice and we have no angles.  
- Corner plan is gone and they control the centre.  
- Multiple misses break the planned setup.

Switch back to building when:  
- They leave a stone open.  
- We gain backing.  
- Their guard protects a weakly buried rock.
