# Curling Team Strategy

## 1. First Ends
- Primary goal is to read the ice.
- Throw as many draws as possible unless a hit or guard is required.

---

## 2. Middle Ends

### With Hammer

#### Lead
- Draw to the sides (8-foot width).
- Keep the centre clean by removing their stones from the middle.
- Goal: open draw for the final stone, or a simple centre removal.

**Side preference logic:**
- Lead draws to the preferred side.
- If the draw is short and becomes a guard → come around it next shot.
- If the draw is good → throw a guard on that same side (“The Box”).

**Avoid:**
- Starting with a centre draw; it encourages them to follow and reduces scoring potential.

**Exception:**
- If the opponent’s lead cannot draw, draw behind the guard.

#### Second
- If we’ve gone outside and the opponent has a centre guard with a buried stone → peel the guard.
- If there is an unguarded stone → board-weight hit, look for a roll.
- If there is a guard and we already have a side stone → draw around the guard (with or without backing).

#### Third
- Remove guards that help the opponent.
- Remove stones that help the opponent.
- Guard stones that help us.
- Draw to backing whenever available.
- General rule: use their mistakes and clear their successes.

#### Skip
- Add points when the end is good.
- Control damage when the end is bad.
- First skip stone should prepare for the final shot.

### Without Hammer

#### General
- If they draw past the T-line and give us backing, draw onto their stone.

#### Lead
- Draw to the centre.
- Ideal placement: top of the 4-foot.

## 3. Universal Principles (Either Situation)

- Prefer draws with backing; avoid giving them backing.
- Better to be top of the house than deep or past the T-line.
- If the choice is a perfect “thin piece” result vs. removing a guard → remove the guard.

---

## 4. Scoreboard Adjustments

- Up after 3 → no guards.
- Down → throw guards.
- Up after 5 → draw to the top of the house and remove their stones. Focus on limiting their scoring chances rather than increasing ours.

---

## 5. Execution Discipline

- Plan for misses. After a long miss, aim slightly short next shot; after a short miss, aim slightly long.
- Everyone plans one shot ahead. If the skip calls something unexpected, say so.
- Time the ice to determine fast/slow areas.
- Watch their broom placements and draw paths; follow their lines.
- If their stone helps us, leave it. If it hurts us and is fully visible, hit it.
