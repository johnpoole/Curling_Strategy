First end(s): figure out the ice, try for as many draws as possible, unless we need a hit or guard for some reason.

Middle end(s)
With hammer: 
Lead -> draw to the sides(8 foot width), clear their rocks from the middle. Ideal is an open draw for the last rock, or a hit to remove theirs from the center.
In particular, the lead draws to whichever side they prefer. If the lead throws short and it ends up a guard, draw behind it next shot. If the draw is good throw the guard.(i.e. "The Box")
Avoid drawing to start because it allows them to follow our draw and make it hard to score.

*If the opponent lead can't draw, then just draw behind the guard.

Second-> If we've throw to the outside and there's a centre guard & and the have a stone behind it, the second peels the guard.
If there's an unguarded rock, board weight hit. Hope for the roll.
If there's a guard and we already have a rock on the side, draw behind the guard if there's backing or nothing.

Third-> Peel guards that help them, remove rocks that help them. Guard rocks that help us, draw to backing. In general, use their mistakes or clear their successes.

Skip-> Pad points, or try to save a bad end. First stone should be to prep for the last stone.

Without hammer:


* In general, if they throw a draw past the t-line that gives us backing, try to draw onto their rock

Without: draws to the center, top of the 4 foot ideally

Either: 
- prefer draws with backing, avoid giving them backing.
- better to be top of the house on draws than past the t-line.
- anytime we consider a "perfect" draw or hit for a piece of a rock, remove the guard instead

If we're up after 3, no guards.
If we're down, guards.

Up after 5: draw to the top of the house and remove their rocks. Focus on making the score they need impossible.(As opposed to trying to win the end)

Plan for misses. Throw too short after throwing long and vice versa.

All of us plan the next shot, if I make a shot call you don't expect, point it out.

Time the ice with a watch to see if it's fast/slow.

Watch the broom placement/draw paths they use and follow their rocks.
if a rock of theirs helps us, we leave it. If it hurts us(and we can see all of it) we hit it.
